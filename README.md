# BloomFilter
Implementation of a Bloom Filter class as a project for the Data Structures college course. 
The __main() function provides an example of how the class works by reading 100,000 words from an external file (wordlist.txt downloaded from http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/data/wordlist.txt) and inserting them in the Bloom Filter, then checking that all words inserted can be found.
